About this
----------
This is a simple code built on a night of inspiration while learning Flex and Ruby. This contains a simple single user server â€“ java & ruby versions [simpleServer.java & server.rb], a multiuser server [chat_server.rb] and the client [client.mxml].

To compile it to a swf
----------------------
Assuming you already have the free Flex SDK just use
$> mxmlc client.mxml
which will create a client.swf file for you.

To Run the multiuser server
---------------------------
User ruby chat_server.rb
or run the Java file
